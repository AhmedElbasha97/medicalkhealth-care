In this project we are strictly observing the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the users’ privacy. We are processing necessary data only - exclusively for the purpose to let users know the technical background of the doctors, while doctors only know superficial info about the patient only to be able to contact with him. The compliance with these regulations is safeguarded by several procedures, e.g. by implementing technical and organizational measures adhering diligently to the high standards of the GDPR. Of course, the app will provide users with a comprehensive privacy statement to be as transparent and clear as possible.
